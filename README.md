# Red-Rabbit
RedRabbit is an ethical hacking toolkit built for pen-testing and reconnaissance. It can be used to identify attack vectors, brute-force protected files, extract saved network passwords, and obfuscate code. RedRabbit, which is made specifically for red teams, is the evil twin of its brother, BlueRabbit, and is the offensive half of the "Rabbit Suite."  The creator of RedRabbit, Ashley Moran, better known as securethelogs, makes a plethora of Windows-based ethical hacking and penetration testing tools. RedRabbit just happens to be one of my favorites.  RedRabbit offers pen-testers of Windows systems an alternative to tools such as PowerShell Empire (or just Empire), which is no longer in development. While not quite picking up the torch in terms of the scope of Empire, a now-depreciated, catch-all tool, RedRabbit is both lightweight and up to date, guaranteeing it will run on most Windows systems.
